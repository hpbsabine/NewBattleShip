1. Compile the project using a C++ compiler.
2. Run the compiled executable.
3. Follow the prompts to play the game.
4. Enter coordinates to target enemy ships and sink them.
5. Use the spotter plane power-up strategically to reveal the location of a computer ship.

How to Play:
- The game is played on a 5x5 grid.
- Each player has three ships to place on their board.
